    dict_qanda = {'What is autism?': ('May Institute', 'Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social interactions and social communication and by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior.'), 'What are some common signs of ASD?': ('NIH', 'Even as infants, children with ASD may seem different, especially when compared to other children their own age. They may become overly focused on certain objects, rarely make eye contact, and fail to engage in typical babbling with their parents. In other cases, children may develop normally until the second or even third year of life, but then start to withdraw and become indifferent to social engagement.The severity of ASD can vary greatly and is based on the degree to which social communication, insistence of sameness of activities and surroundings, and repetitive patterns of behavior affect the daily functioning of the individual. Social impairment and communication difficulties: Many people with ASD find social interactions difficult. The mutual give-and-take nature of typical communication and interaction is often particularly challenging. Children with ASD may fail to respond to their names, avoid eye contact with other people, and only interact with others to achieve specific goals. Often children with ASD do not understand how to play or engage with other children and may prefer to be alone. People with ASD may find it difficult to understand other people’s feelings or talk about their own feelings. People with ASD may have very different verbal abilities ranging from no speech at all to speech that is fluent, but awkward and inappropriate. Some children with ASD may have delayed speech and language skills, may repeat phrases, and give unrelated answers to questions. In addition, people with ASD can have a hard time using and understanding non-verbal cues such as gestures, body language, or tone of voice. For example, young children with ASD might not understand what it means to wave goodbye. People with ASD may also speak in flat, robot-like or a sing-song voice about a narrow range of favorite topics, with little regard for the interests of the person to whom they are speaking. Repetitive and characteristic behaviors: Many children with ASD engage in repetitive movements or unusual behaviors such as flapping their arms, rocking from side to side, or twirling. They may become preoccupied with parts of objects like the wheels on a toy truck. Children may also become obsessively interested in a particular topic such as airplanes or memorizing train schedules. Many people with ASD seem to thrive so much on routine that changes to the daily patterns of life — like an unexpected stop on the way home from school — can be very challenging. Some children may even get angry or have emotional outbursts, especially when placed in a new or overly stimulating environment.'), 'What disorders are related to ASD?': ('NIH', 'Certain known genetic disorders are associated with an increased risk for autism, including Fragile X syndrome (which causes intellectual disability) and tuberous sclerosis (which causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and other vital organs) — each of which results from a mutation in a single, but different, gene. Recently, researchers have discovered other genetic mutations in children diagnosed with autism, including some that have not yet been designated as named syndromes. While each of these disorders is rare, in aggregate, they may account for 20 percent or more of all autism cases. People with ASD also have a higher than average risk of having epilepsy. Children whose language skills regress early in life — before age 3 — appear to have a risk of developing epilepsy or seizure-like brain activity. About 20 to 30 percent of children with ASD develop epilepsy by the time they reach adulthood. Additionally, people with both ASD and intellectual disability have the greatest risk of developing seizure disorder.'), 'How is ASD diagnosed?': ('May Institute', 'There are no medical tests for diagnosing ASD, but when parents become concerned about developmental delays in children, they should consult a physician. He or she can rule out various potential medical causes, such as hearing problems. Before a child can be diagnosed, that child should be evaluated by an autism specialist. Such a person may be a psychologist, psychiatrist, pediatric neurologist, or developmental pediatrician who specializes in diagnosing and treating children with ASD. Best practice guidelines identify the following six components of a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation for autism: Parent or caregiver interview; Review of relevant medical, psychological, and/or school records; Cognitive/developmental assessment ; Direct play observation; Measurement of adaptive functioning; Comprehensive medical examination. ASD diagnostic criteria are described by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in its Diagnostic & Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Qualified professionals provide these diagnoses when symptoms of ASD (social interaction and social communication, and repetitive behaviors) are present in ranges that are inappropriate for the child’s age and developmental level. ASD is diagnosed when all these symptoms are present to some degree. A diagnosis also includes a specification of severity. Specifically, qualified professionals will use information gathered during the diagnostic assessment to indicate the level of support an individual with ASD requires: Level 1 Requiring Support; Level 2 Requiring Substantial Support; Level 3 Requiring Very Substantial Support.'), 'What causes ASD?': ('NIH', 'Scientists believe that both genetics and environment likely play a role in ASD. There is great concern that rates of autism have been increasing in recent decades without full explanation as to why. Researchers have identified a number of genes associated with the disorder. Imaging studies of people with ASD have found differences in the development of several regions of the brain. Studies suggest that ASD could be a result of disruptions in normal brain growth very early in development. These disruptions may be the result of defects in genes that control brain development and regulate how brain cells communicate with each other. Autism is more common in children born prematurely. Environmental factors may also play a role in gene function and development, but no specific environmental causes have yet been identified. The theory that parental practices are responsible for ASD has long been disproved. Multiple studies have shown that vaccination to prevent childhood infectious diseases does not increase the risk of autism in the population.'), 'What role do genes play?': ('NIH', 'Twin and family studies strongly suggest that some people have a genetic predisposition to autism. Identical twin studies show that if one twin is affected, then the other will be affected between 36 to 95 percent of the time. There are a number of studies in progress to determine the specific genetic factors associated with the development of ASD. In families with one child with ASD, the risk of having a second child with the disorder also increases. Many of the genes found to be associated with autism are involved in the function of the chemical connections between brain neurons (synapses). Researchers are looking for clues about which genes contribute to increased susceptibility. In some cases, parents and other relatives of a child with ASD show mild impairments in social communication skills or engage in repetitive behaviors. Evidence also suggests that emotional disorders such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia occur more frequently than average in the families of people with ASD. In addition to genetic variations that are inherited and are present in nearly all of a person’s cells, recent research has also shown that de novo, or spontaneous, gene mutations can influence the risk of developing autism spectrum disorder. De novo mutations are changes in sequences of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, the hereditary material in humans, which can occur spontaneously in a parent’s sperm or egg cell or during fertilization. The mutation then occurs in each cell as the fertilized egg divides. These mutations may affect single genes or they may be changes called copy number variations, in which stretches of DNA containing multiple genes are deleted or duplicated.  Recent studies have shown that people with ASD tend to have more copy number de novo gene mutations than those without the disorder, suggesting that for some the risk of developing ASD is not the result of mutations in individual genes but rather spontaneous coding mutations across many genes.  De novo mutations may explain genetic disorders in which an affected child has the mutation in each cell but the parents do not and there is no family pattern to the disorder. Autism risk also increases in children born to older parents. There is still much research to be done to determine the potential role of environmental factors on spontaneous mutations and how that influences ASD risk.'), 'Do symptoms of autism change over time?': ('NIH', 'For many children, symptoms improve with age and behavioral treatment. During adolescence, some children with ASD may become depressed or experience behavioral problems, and their treatment may need some modification as they transition to adulthood. People with ASD usually continue to need services and supports as they get older, but depending on severity of the disorder, people with ASD may be able to work successfully and live independently or within a supportive environment.'), 'How is autism treated?': ('NIH', 'There is no cure for ASD. Therapies and behavioral interventions are designed to remedy specific symptoms and can substantially improve those symptoms. The ideal treatment plan coordinates therapies and interventions that meet the specific needs of the individual. Most health care professionals agree that the earlier the intervention, the better. Educational/behavioral interventions: Early behavioral/educational interventions have been very successful in many children with ASD. In these interventions therapists use highly structured and intensive skill-oriented training sessions to help children develop social and language skills, such as applied behavioral analysis, which encourages positive behaviors and discourages negative ones. In addition, family counseling for the parents and siblings of children with ASD often helps families cope with the particular challenges of living with a child with ASD. Medications: While medication can’t cure ASD or even treat its main symptoms, there are some that can help with related symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Antipsychotic medications are used to treat severe behavioral problems. Seizures can be treated with one or more anticonvulsant drugs. Medication used to treat people with attention deficit disorder can be used effectively to help decrease impulsivity and hyperactivity in people with ASD. Parents, caregivers, and people with autism should use caution before adopting any unproven treatments.'), 'How early can autism be identified? What should parents do if they are concerned their young child may have autism?': ('American Psychiatric Association', 'Some of the signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be noticed before the age of 1, although a reliable diagnosis by an autism specialist can be made in children as young as 18 months of age. Unfortunately many children end up waiting until after their 4th birthday to be diagnosed with ASD. Delays in seeking an initial assessment and limited access to specialists are just a couple of factors that help to explain this delay. Children who have less severe ASD, or are from minority backgrounds, tend to be diagnosed later than those with severe symptoms. Researchers are developing ways of being able to diagnose autism at even younger ages, such as using eye tracking technologies. The diagnosis of autism is typically based on a clinical examination, which is often supported with other information and tests. There is no single scan or blood test that can independently diagnose autism. An advice to parents is to trust their gut instinct when they are worried about their child and to seek the advice of their primary care pediatrician. This general assessment may then lead to a referral to a specialist who will perform a more comprehensive evaluation. Parents should also feel empowered to ask for a specialist opinion if they do not feel adequately reassured by a primary care evaluation.'), 'Can children “grow out” of autism?': ('American Psychiatric Association', 'A small minority of children show considerable improvement in their ASD symptoms following diagnosis. While ASD has historically been considered a life-long condition, recent research has shown that the outcomes associated with an ASD diagnosis can vary considerably. Some people who were diagnosed with ASD in their youth may improve dramatically, and show little difference to people who have never had the diagnosis. Whether these individuals “grew out” of autism, or simply responded exceptionally well to the therapeutic interventions, remains up for debate. One should also question if the initial diagnosis of ASD was accurate in these cases. At the moment it is difficult to identify which children will “grow out” of autism, although those who have less severe symptoms and those who obtain early access to the appropriate therapies appear to have better outcomes. There is so much information about therapies, treatments and diets for children with autism — how do I know what’s right for my child? Parents naturally want the best for their child, and many will try different treatments, diets and therapies to help their loved one. It is difficult to cover all of the numerous therapies but here are the key points: Medical and psychiatric conditions that co-exist with ASD should be identified and treated by a suitably trained physician. These can include immune problems, digestive problems and ADHD. Natural therapies or treatments are often advertised as being safe and effective. Unfortunately most of these treatments do not have high quality scientific evidence that supports either claim. Some parents have described improvements in their child by using specialized diets. The most important point here is to make sure the child receives enough calories and nutrients regardless of the dietary change. Parents should be very cautious of treatments that are advertised as being able to “cure” autism; these claims are often of a dubious nature.'), 'How do caregivers and educators begin teaching verbal communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', 'When teaching spoken communication the most important factor will be motivation! Before you start any communication intervention, you must know the child and find things that motivate him or her. What are the child’s favorite things to do? What are his or her favorite games, places, people? What makes the child laugh? As you determine the items that motivate the child, consider the following areas: physical activities (running, jumping), toys (trains, dolls), edibles (food), liquids (drinks), activities (computer games), social interactions (playing with a sibling, tickle games, peek-a-boo). It will also be helpful to identify items that are considered to be repetitive or restricted patterns of behavior in which the child engages and enjoys. For example, a child might like watching items spin, enjoy flicking a string up and down, or like driving a car on a track over and over.'), 'When should caregivers and educators teach verbal communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', '"Adults should teach when the child is motivated to communicate! This will likely be when the child is engaged in his or her favorite activities. Caregivers and educators can embed strategies into the child\'s favorite activities and use the child\'s favorite toys and foods to elicit communication. For example, if the child loves gross motor activities, like running, jumping on the bed, being spun and thrown in the air, then these times can be used to teach him or her to communicate. When teaching spoken communication, begin by teaching the child to request an item. Requesting is a basic function of communication and is the best starting point, as it helps the child to get needs and desires met. Using motivational moments will allow the caregiver or educator to capitalize on the child\'s desires. If the child is whining to get something or reaching for a desired item, this is the perfect opportunity to get the child to request. Do not automatically give the item to him/her. Instead, use this as a teachable moment! We can begin teaching communication by taking advantage of ""naturally occurring opportunities."" Naturally occurring opportunities are activities and events that happen naturally throughout the day. Because learning to communicate orally may be difficult for the child we will want to be sure there are plenty of teaching opportunities. Therefore, in addition to the naturally occurring opportunities, we also want to provide ""planned opportunities"" for teaching communication. By planning opportunities to work on communication we can expand the times to teach communication!"'), 'What are naturally occurring opportunities and how are they used to teach communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', "Naturally occurring opportunities are natural, everyday situations that we can use as the context for learning. Naturally occurring opportunities can be determined by just sitting back and watching! Observe the child's play and see what the child is playing with and what interests him or her. Learning to communicate is a very social process and children learn to communicate best with their caregivers during everyday interactions that are fun and motivating! When children learn to communicate during these activities they are naturally rewarded by engaging in their favorite type of play, eating their favorite food, and enjoying their favorite drink. For example, taking a bike or car ride, a bath, eating dinner, having an afternoon snack, meeting dad at the door – these are all natural, everyday situations when communication opportunities are present."), 'What are planned opportunities and how are they used to teach communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', "Additional opportunities must be planned by caregivers or educators. Teaching spoken communication skills is not something that will come easily. The child must receive many learning opportunities. While it is essential to take advantage of the natural opportunities that arise, often, these are not enough. Planned opportunities are those times the caregiver or educator sets aside to work on communication. The adult can use the same motivational items and activities, but will create the opportunities for the child to communicate. For example, perhaps after lunch and again after dinner there is a 20 minute period designated to work one-on-one with the child and target communication. These 20 minutes should be planned opportunities but still be a part of the regular routine. After lunch the caregiver could get out the child's favorite train track and building blocks and engage him or her in play which leads to many communication opportunities. After dinner, they may go outside and play on the swing and slide, providing additional opportunities."), 'How can caregivers and educators set up opportunities for communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', '"There are numerous ways we can elicit spoken communication. The following strategies can be used to create learning opportunities while simultaneously keeping the child motivated to communicate! Arrange the environment to keep the child\'s favorite toys out of reach or in containers that are hard to open. This will require the child to communicate to indicate he would like to play with the toy. Give the child small amounts of the item requested. For example, Sarah\'s favorite food is cereal. To elicit communication at breakfast time only give Sarah a tiny bit of cereal and when she is done, wait for her to communicate in some way before giving her more. Set up problem solving situations. For example, have a piece of puzzle missing or give the child a juice box without a straw. Give the child the wrong item requested. When Sarah says cereal, elicit more communication by giving her the wrong item--fruit. This way she will have to communicate to say, ""NO! Cereal!"" Build on the child\'s own motives and interests. During the activity, use the motivational item to provide many, many opportunities to communicate. For example, when working on communication during bath time, splash the water and prompt the child to say, ""splash."" Do this many times in a row. Later, show the rubber ducky and then work on the child saying, ""duck."" Later, move to pouring water, and so on."'), 'What are the steps to teach communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', '"1.Interact with the child during the activity. Play with the child and make the activity fun and engaging. 2.Elaborate on the child\'s communication by providing a model. Label or say the word the child is to learn. If he or she is playing with a ball label it by saying, ""ball."" As the word is modeled, start by saying the word multiple times, pausing in between and saying the word calmly.3.Expand the child\'s language. Eventually pair words together and increase what the child is to say. Here is an example of expanding: ""Yellow ball!"" ""What do you want?"" ""Throw yellow ball!"" 4.Be patient and pause to allow the child to communicate. Provide a model and then wait several seconds. It may be necessary to wait 15 or more seconds to allow the child to process. After multiple language models, begin adding in a pause to allow the child to interact. The goal is to give the child an opportunity to respond and to speak. For example, you can say ""What are you playing with? (pause) It’s a (pause) ball!"""'), 'How do caregivers and parents prompt communication?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', '"When teaching spoken communication, a prompt can be provided. The prompt can provide the entire word or phrase the child is to say. For example, when showing the child a duck the prompt simply would be, ""duck."" A prompt also can provide only part of the word or phrase. For example, as the child is learning to say the word duck, the prompt may be, ""du."" This type of prompt provides just enough of a cue to remind the child what he is to say. When using prompts be sure to fade the prompts or increase the expectation for communication. The ultimate goal should be for the child to communicate independently; however, if the child is constantly being prompted he will not get the opportunity to be an independent communicator."'), 'What are the most important tips to remember when teaching a child to verbally communicate?': ('Heather Fleming, M.Ed. and Dawn Hendricks, Ph.D.', '"Teach words that are meaningful and that are of interest to the child. Some early words are: all done, up, want, drink, or a favorite food item. Many caregivers teach the words \'please\' or \'more\' first, which are great words to use for requesting; however their meaning can vary depending on the context. For example, if the child is eating dinner and asks for \'more\' it is not clear if they are referring to \'more food\' or \'more drink.\' By teaching the child the word \'milk\' it is obvious what the child wants. Gross motor skills are often a strength for children with ASD, thus teaching verbs first is also very motivating and practical for children. Identify the activities of the day when you are going to teach communication. These are the \'additional opportunities\' or planned opportunities discussed earlier in this fact sheet. It is best to identify the specific activities so they are remembered and the child is provided ample opportunities to communicate each day. Be prepared for multiple trials. Children with ASD may require many learning trials to learn to speak. Every child with ASD is different. Some will learn to imitate and respond to your vocalizations quickly and some will take longer to respond. Incorporate high intensity reactions! High intensity reactions motivate children to speak by getting their attention and getting them excited about the activity. If the caregiver is excited about the activity, the child will be too. Have fun during play! Talk! Even if the child is unresponsive. Talk to the child about their play using short sentences. Narrate what they are doing and then pause to let them speak. Caregivers often state they stop speaking with their child because their child is not responding. Even if the child is unresponsive, never stop talking! Talking with children helps them process and attend to language, and understand that it is meaningful. Praise and reinforce the approximations. Reinforcement for spoken communication should be easy. The child gets the item he or she wants! Keep in mind that we have to start somewhere, so praise and reinforce the approximations and the attempts to communicate. Reinforce the child for trying. Do not just reinforce if the word is spoken perfectly. Pause to give the child a chance to respond. For example, when a child is pointing to a ball, say ""Do you want your ball?"" then wait for the child to respond. Children with ASD might take many seconds to process information and respond, so be patient. Imitate and elaborate the child’s vocalizations. Imitate and elaborate the vocalizations so they know what they said is meaningful! When the child points at a cookie and says ""ookie"" you can say, ""Oh,you want a COOKIE?"" When elaborating and expanding on the vocalizations, it helps them learn to expand their own language."'), 'What are the symptoms of ASD?': ('May Institute', 'Social Interaction and Social Communication: Child shows little interest in making friends; initiates social interactions primarily to have immediate needs met (e.g., to get food, referred toy); and tends not to share accomplishments and experiences. Other symptoms include lack of eye contact, and absent or limited and atypical gestures (e.g., using someone’s hand as a tool for opening the door). Loss of language occurs in some cases.  Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behaviors: Intensely repetitive motor movements or use of objects; child is consumed with a single item, idea, or person; experiences difficulty with changes in the environment or transitioning from one situation to another; may have frequent tantrums; and may be aggressive or self-injurious.'), 'How prevalent is ASD?': ('May Institute', 'The number of diagnosed cases of autism and related disorders has dramatically increased over the past decade. According to the most recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018), ASD occurs in approximately one in every 59 births. ASD is one of the most common serious developmental disabilities, and is almost five times more likely to occur in boys than in girls.'), 'Do people with an autism spectrum disorder always suffer from intellectual disability?': ('World Health Organization', 'The level of intellectual functioning is extremely variable in persons with an autism spectrum disorder, ranging from profound impairment to superior non-verbal cognitive skills. It is estimated that around 50% of persons with ASD also suffer from an intellectual disability.'), 'How early can an autism spectrum disorder be recognized in children?': ('World Health Organization', 'Identifying an autism spectrum disorder is difficult before the age of about 12 months but diagnosis is generally possible by the age of 2 years. Characteristic features of the onset include delay in the development or temporary regression in language and social skills and repetitive stereotyped patterns of behaviour.'), 'What can parents do to help their child with an autism spectrum disorder?': ('World Health Organization', 'Parents have an essential role in providing support to a child with an autism spectrum disorder. They can help to ensure access to health services and education, and offer nurturing and stimulating environments as their child grows up. Recently, it has been shown that parents can also help deliver psychosocial and behavioral treatments to their own children.'), 'What causes autism spectrum disorders?': ('World Health Organization', 'Scientific evidence suggests that various factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the onset of autism spectrum disorders by influencing early brain development.'), 'Are childhood vaccines responsible for autism spectrum disorders?': ('World Health Organization', 'Available epidemiological data show that there is no evidence of a link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies suggesting a causal link were found to be seriously flawed.'), 'Why Was My Child? Diagnosed with Autism?And What Does It Mean?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Your child has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and you have asked for help. This is an important turning point in a long journey. For some families, it may be the point when, after a long search for answers, you now have a name for something you didn’t know what to call, but you knew existed. Perhaps you suspected autism, but held out hope that an evaluation would prove otherwise. Many families report mixed feelings of sadness and relief when their child is diagnosed. You may feel completely overwhelmed. Y ou may also feel relieved to know that the concerns you have had for your child are valid. Whatever it is you feel, know that thousands of parents share this journey. You are not alone. There is reason to hope. There is help.'), 'Why Does My Child Need a Diagnosis of Autism?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Parents are usually the first to notice the early signs of autism. You probably noticed that your child was developing differently from his or her peers. The differences may have existed from birth or may have become more noticeable later. Sometimes, the differences are severe and obvious to everyone. In other cases, they are more subtle and are first recognized by a daycare provider or preschool teacher. Those differences, the symptoms of autism, have led thousands of parents like you to seek answers that have resulted in a diagnosis of autism. You may wonder: Why does my child need a diagnosis of autism? That’s a fair q uestion to ask - especially when right now, no one is able to offer you a cure. Autism Speaks is dedicated to funding global biomedical research into the causes, prevention, treatments and a possible cure for autism. Great strides have been made and the current state of progress is a far cry from the time when parents were given no hope for their children. Some of the most brilliant minds of our time have turned their attention toward this disorder. There are, however, several reasons why having a diagnosis is important for your child. A thorough and detailed diagnosis provides important information about your child’s behavior and development. It can help create a roadmap for treatment by identifying your child’s specific strengths and challenges and providing useful information about which needs and skills should be targeted for effective intervention. A diagnosis is often required to access autism-specific services through early intervention programs or your local school district.'), 'How is Autism Diagnosed?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Presently, we don’t have a medical test that can diagnose autism. As the symptoms of autism vary, so do the routes to obtaining a diagnosis. Y ou may have raised q uestions with your pediatrician. Some children are identified as having developmental delays before obtaining a diagnosis of autism and may already receive some Early Interv ention or Special Ed ucation services. Unfortunately, parents’ concerns are sometimes not taken seriously by their doctor and as a result, a diagnosis is delayed. Autism Speaks and other autism-related organizations are working hard to educate parents and physicians, so that children with autism are identified as early as possible. Your child may have been diagnosed by a developmental ped iatrician, a neurologist, a psychiatrist or a psychologist. In some cases, a team of specialists may have evaluated your child and provided recommendations for treatment. The team may have included an aud iologist to rule out hearing loss, a speech & language therapist to determine language skills and needs and an occupational therapist to evaluate physical and motor skills. A multi-disciplinary evaluation is important for diagnosing autism and other challenges that often accompany autism, such as delays in motor skills. If your child has not been evaluated by a multi-disciplinary team, you will want to make sure further evaluations are conducted so that you can learn as much as possible about your child’s individual strengths and needs. Once you have received a formal diagnosis, it is important to make sure that you ask for a comprehensive report that includes the diagnosis in writing, as well as recommendations for treatment. The doctor may not be able to provide this for you at the appointment, as it may take some time to compile, but be sure to follow up and pick up this helpful necessary report as soon as it’s available.'), 'How Common is Autism?': ('CDC', '1 in 58 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in the United States.'), 'Social symptoms': ('Autism Speaks', 'Typically developing infants are social by nature. They gaze at faces, turn toward voices, grasp a finger and even smile by 2 to 3 months of age. By contrast, most children who develop autism have difficulty engaging in the give-and-take of everyday human interactions. By 8 to 1 0 months of age, many infants who go on to develop autism are showing some symptoms such as failure to respond to their names, reduced interest in people and delayed babbling. By toddlerhood, many children with autism have difficulty playing social games, don’t imitate the actions of others and prefer to play alone. They may fail to seek comfort or respond to parents’ displays of anger or affection in typical ways. Research suggests that children with autism are attached to their parents. However, the way they express this attachment can be unusual. To parents, it may seem as if their child is disconnected. Both children and adults with autism also tend to have difficulty interpreting what others are thinking and feeling. Subtle social cues such as a smile, wave or grimace may convey little meaning. To a person who misses these social cues, a statement like “Come here!” may mean the same thing, regardless of whether the speaker is smiling and extending her arms for a hug or frowning and planting her fists on her hips. Without the ability to interpret gestures and facial expressions, the social world can seem bewildering. Many people with autism have similar difficulty seeing things from another person’s perspective. Most five-year-olds understand that other people have different thoughts, feelings and goals than they have. A person with autism may lack such understanding. This, in turn, can interfere with the ability to predict or understand another person’s actions. It is common – but not universal – for those with autism to have difficulty regulating emotions. This can take the form of seemingly “immature” behavior such as crying or having outbursts in inappropriate situations. It can also lead to disruptive and physically aggressive behavior. The tendency to “lose control” may be particularly pronounced in unfamiliar, overwhelming or frustrating situations. Frustration can also result in self-injurious behaviors such as head banging, hair pulling or self-biting. Fortunately, children with autism can be taught how to socially interact, use gestures and recognize facial expressions. Also, there are many strategies that can be used to help the child with autism deal with frustration so that he or she doesn’t have to resort to challenging behaviors. We will discuss this later.'), 'Communication difficulties': ('Autism Speaks', 'Young children with autism tend to be delayed in babbling, speaking and learning to use gestures. Some infants who later develop autism coo and babble during the first few months of life before losing these communicative behaviors. Others experience significant anguage delays and don’t begin to speak until much later. With therapy, however, most people with autism do learn to use spoken language and all can learn to communicate. Many nonverbal or nearly nonverbal children and adults learn to use communication systems such as pictures, sign language, electronic word processors or even speech-generating devices. When language begins to develop, people with autism may use speech in unusual ways. Some have difficulty combining words into meaningful sentences. They may speak only single words or repeat the same phrase over and over. Some go through a stage where they repeat what they hear verbatim (echolalia). Many parents assume difficulties expressing language automatically mean their child isn’t able to understand the language of others, but this is not always the case. It is important to distinguish between expressive language and receptive language. Children with difficulties in expressive language are often unable to express what they are thinking through language, whereas children with difficulties in receptive language are often unable to understand what others are saying. Therefore, the fact that your child may seem unable to express him or herself through language does not necessarily mean he or she is unable to comprehend the language of others. Be sure to talk to your doctor or look for signs that your child is able to interpret language, as this important distinction will affect the way you communicate with him or her. It is important to understand the importance of pragmatics when looking to improve and expand upon your child’s communication skills. \U00100033ragmatics are social rules for using language in a meaningful context or conversation. While it is important that your child learns how to communicate through words or sentences, it is also key to emphasize both when and where the specific message should be conveyed. Challenges in pragmatics are a common feature of spoken language difficulties in children with autism. These challenges may become more apparent as your child gets older. Some mildly affected children exhibit only slight delays in language or even develop precocious language and unusually large vocabularies – yet have difficulty sustaining a conversation. Some children and adults with autism tend to carry on monologues on a favorite subject, giving others little chance to comment. In other words, the ordinary “give-and-take” of conversation proves difficult. Some children with ASD with superior language skills tend to speak like little professors, failing to pick up on the “kid-speak” that’s common among their peers. Another common difficulty is the inability to understand body language, tone of voice and expressions that aren’t meant to be taken literally. For example, even an adult with autism might interpret a sarcastic “Oh, that’s just great!” as meaning it really is great. Conversely, individuals affected by autism may not exhibit typical body language. Facial expressions, movements and gestures may not match what they are saying. Their tone of voice may fail to reflect their feelings. Some use a high-pitched sing song or a flat, robot-like voice. This can make it difficult for others to know what they want and need. This failed communication, in turn, can lead to frustration and inappropriate behavior (such as screaming or grabbing) on the part of the person with autism. Fortunately, there are proven methods for helping children and adults with autism learn better ways to express their needs. As the person with autism learns to communicate what he or she wants, challenging behaviors often subside. Children with autism often have difficulty letting others know what they want or need until they are taught how to communicate through speech, gestures or other means.'), ' Repetitive and restricted behaviors': ('Autism Speaks', 'Unusual repetitive behaviors and/or a tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities are another core symptom of autism. Common repetitive behaviors include hand-flapping, rocking, jumping and twirling, arranging and rearranging objects and repeating sounds, words or phrases. Sometimes the repetitive behavior is self-stimulating, such as wiggling fingers in front of the eyes. The tendency to engage in a restricted range of activities can be seen in the way that many children with autism play with toys. Some spend hours lining up toys in a specific way instead of using them for pretend play. Similarly, some adults are preoccupied with having household or other objects in a fixed order or place. It can prove extremely upsetting if someone or something disrupts the order. Along these lines, many children and adults with autism need and demand extreme consistency in their environment and daily routine. Slight changes can be extremely stressful and lead to outbursts. Repetitive behaviors can take the form of intense preoccupations or obsessions. These extreme interests can prove all the more unusual for their content (e.g. fans, vacuum cleaners or toilets) or depth of knowledge (e.g. knowing and repeating astonishingly detailed information about Thomas the Tank Engine or astronomy). Older children and adults with autism may develop tremendous interest in numbers, symbols, dates or science topics.'), 'How Can My Child Have Autism When He Seems So Smart?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Right now you might be thinking about all the things your child with autism learned at a much younger age than other children you know. And yes, you are right: there are also things that children with autism learn on their own much faster than their typically developing peers or siblings. For example, they can be very good at learning to pick out their favorite DVD from a stack, even when it’s not in its case. They may learn at a very young age how to operate the remote controls to the TV and DVD player so that they can rewind their videos to their favorite parts (or fast forward through the parts they don’t like). They can be very creative in figuring out ways to climb up on the counter to reach a cabinet that has their favorite cereal or even how to use the key to unlock the dead bolt on the back door so they can go outside to play on the swing. Clearly, these are not behaviors that you would even think about trying to teach a two-year-old child. And yet some children with autism somehow manage to acquire these skills on their own. How can we understand this inconsistency between the things children with autism do and don’t learn? How can a child who can’t put different shapes into a shape sorter learn to turn on the TV and DVD player, put a DVD in and push the play button? How can a child who can’t understand a simple direction like “get your coat” figure out how to unlock a door to get outside? What accounts for this unique learning style? In a word: motivation. We all pay attention better to the things that interest us, so we become much more proficient at learning them. Understanding what is motivating to your child (all children are different) will be one of the keys to increasing their learning and their skills. Your child’s special talents may be part of his unique and inherent learning style and nature.'), 'What is Free and Appropriate Education (FAPE)?': ('Autism Speaks', 'As described previously, IDEA provides for a “free and appropriate education” for all children with disabilities. Each word in this phrase is important, but “appropriate” is the one that relates specifically to your special needs child. Y our child is entitled to an education that is tailored to his or her special needs and a placement that will allow him or her to make educational progress. Although you and your child’s teachers or therapists may want to provide your child with the best and optimal programs and services, the school district is simply req uired to provide an appropriate education. One of the challenges here is working with the school district to determine what is appropriate and therefore what will be provided for your child. This is a collaborative process and may require considerable negotiation in order to secure the appropriate services from the school.'), 'What is least restrictive environment (LRE)?': ('Autism Speaks', 'As specified in the IDEA, your child is entitled to experience the “l east restrictiv e env ironment” in schools. This means that your child should be placed in the environment in which he or she has the greatest possible opportunity to interact with children who do not have a disability and to participate in the general education curriculum. The child must be educated in the school he or she would attend if not disabled to the maximum extent appropriate and supported with the aids and services req uired to make this possible. This does not mean that every student has to be in a general education classroom, but the objective is to place the student in as natural a learning environment as possible, within his or her home community. This decision is made by the members of the Individualized Education Program (IEP) team, with consideration of the myriad of issues related to appropriate environment and supports for the student. Placements and the LRE for a particular student may change over time. The participation of children with disabilities in the general education environment is often referred to as “m ainstreaming” or “i nclusion”. Inclusion does not mean that a child with special needs should be placed into a general education setting just like a typical learner; a variety of special education supports should be provided in order to create a successful environment and positive experience for everyone involved. Careful planning and training are essential to providing modifications or accommodations and to successfully situating a child with a disability in theleast restrictive setting. These supports might include providing a specially trained classroom or one-on-one paraprofessional, altering testing environments or expectations, adapting curriculum, providing visual supports or adaptive eq uipment, etc. The  special education department should provide training, strategies and support for general education staff and others in the general school community who may interact with students with special needs. It is imporimportant to note that philosophies about inclusion vary considerably among school districts, staff and parents of students with and without special needs. IDEA provides for a team approach to planning so that the objectives of all members of the team can be considered and the necessary supports can be put in place to maximize inclusion. Not all parents will feel that a mainstream environment will enhance the growth and development of their student with special needs and allowances need to be made to accommodate various perspectives. Additionally, not all students will be ready for full inclusion all of the time. The anxiety and sensory issues related to inclusion may mean that efforts should begin with small steps that can generate ongoing success and increase participation within the local student body and community.'), 'Autism and insurance?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Autism Speaks Insurance Link was developed to help families navigate the complexities of health insurance for autism. By answering a short series of questions, this online application will help parents determine whether their dependent is entitled to autism benefits under their health insurance plan. If not covered, Autism Speaks Insurance Link will provide parents with the tools to effectively advocate for meaningful coverage for the treatment of autism.

And to access the Autism Speaks Insurance Link please visit autismspeaks.org/ad v ocacy/insurancelink.'), 'What is Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA)?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Behavior analysis was originally described by B.F. Skinner in the 1930s. You may have learned about Skinner and “operant conditioning” when you studied science in school. The principles and methods of behavior analysis have been applied effectively in many circumstances to develop a wide range of skills in learners with and without disabilities. Behavior analysis is a scientifically validated approach to understanding behavior and how it is affected by the environment. In this context, “behavior” refers to actions and skills. “Environment” includes any influence – physical or social – that might change or be changed by one’s behavior. On a practical level, the principles and methods of behavior analysis have helped many different kinds of learners acquire many different skills – from healthier lifestyles to the mastery of a new language. Behavior analysis focuses on the principles that explain how learning takes place. Positive reinforcement is one such principle. When a behavior is followed by some sort of reward, the behavior is more likely to be repeated. Through decades of research, the field of behavior analysis has developed many techniques for increasing useful behaviors and reducing those that may cause harm or interfere with learning. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is the use of these techniq ues and principles to bring about meaningful and positive change in behavior. Since the early 1960 s, ABA has been used by thousands of therapists to teach communication, play, social, academic, self-care, work and community living skills and to reduce problem behaviors in learners with autism. There is a great deal of research that has demonstrated that ABA is effective for improving children’s outcomes, especially their cognitive and language abilities. Over the past several decades, different models using ABA have emerged, all of which use behavioral teaching. They all use strategies that are based on Skinner’s work. ABA is often difficult to understand until you see it in action. It may be helpful to start by describing what all of the different methods of ABA have in common. ABA methods use the following three step process to teach: An antecedent, which is a verbal or physical stimuu s such as a command or requ est. This may come from the envi ronment or from anoth er p erson or b e internal to th e subject; A resu lting behavior, which is th e su b ject’s (or in th is case, th e ch il d’s) resp onse or lack of resp onse to th e antecedent; A consequence, w h ich dep ends on th e b eh avi or, can include positive reinforcement of th e desired behavior or no reaction for incorrect resp onses. ABA targets the learning of skills and the reduction of challenging behaviors. Most ABA programs are highly structured. Targeted skills and behaviors are based on an established curriculum. Each skill is broken down into small steps and taught using prompts that are gradually eliminated as the steps are mastered. The child is given repeated opportunities to learn and practice each step in a variety of settings. Each time the child achieves the desired result, he or she receives positive reinforcement, such as verbal praise or something else that the child finds to be highly motivating, like a small piece of candy. ABA programs often include support for the child in a school setting with a one-on-one aide to target the systemic transfer of skills to a typical school environment. Skills are broken down into manageable pieces and built upon so that a child learns how to learn in a natural environment. Facilitated play with peers is often part of the intervention. Success is measured by direct observation and data collection and analysis – all critical components of ABA. If the child isn’t making satisfactory progress, adjustments are made. One type of ABA intervention is D iscrete Trial Teaching ( also referred to as DTT, “ traditional ABA” or the Lovaas Model, for its pioneer, Dr. Ivar Lovaas). DTT involves teaching individual skills one at a time using several repeated teaching trials and reinforcers that may or may not be intrinsically related to the skill that is being taught.'), 'What is the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)?': ('Autism Speaks', 'The Early Start D env er Model (ESDM) is a comprehensive behavioral early intervention approach for children with autism, ages 1 2 to 4 8 months. The program encompasses a developmental curriculum that defines the skills to be taught at any given time and a set of teaching procedures used to deliver this content. It is not tied to a specific delivery setting, but can be delivered by therapy teams and/or parents in group programs or individual therapy sessions in either a clinic setting or the child’s home. Psychologists Sally Rogers, Ph.D., and Geraldine Dawson, Ph.D., developed the Early Start Denver Model as an early-age extension of the Denver Model, which Rogers and colleagues developed and refined. This early intervention program integrates a relationship-focused developmental model with the well-validated teaching practices of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). Its core features include the following: Naturalistic applied behavioral analytic strategies Sensitive to normal developmental sequence Deep parental involvement Focus on interpersonal exchange and positive affect Shared engagement with joint activities Language and communication taught inside a positive, affect-based relationship The Early Start Denver Model is the only comprehensive early intervention model that has been validated in a randomized clinical trial for use with children with autism as young as 18 months of age. It has been found to be effective for children with autism across a wide range of learning styles and abilities.'), 'Is There a Cure?': ('Autism Speaks', 'Is recovery possible? You may have heard about children who have recovered from autism. Although relatively rare, it is estimated that approximately 10% of children lose their diagnosis of autism. The factors that predict which children lose their diagnosis are unknown. Children initially diagnosed with autism who lose their diagnosis often have residual difficulties in the areas of hyperactivity, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Symptom reduction from autism is usually reported in connection with intensive early intervention, but it is unknown how much or which type of intervention works best or whether the recovery can be fully credited to the intervention. You may also hear about children who reach “best outcome” status, which means they score normally on tests for IQ, language, adaptive functioning, school placement and personality, but have mild symptoms on some personality and diagnostic tests. Recent epidemiology studies estimate that approximately 60% of children with autism have IQ’s above 70 by age eight (70 is the cut-off point for developmental delay). Presently, there is no reliable way of predicting which children will have the best outcomes. In the absence of a cure or even an accurate prognosis of your child’s future, do not be afraid to believe in your child’s potential. All children with autism will benefit from intervention. All will make very significant, meaningful progress.'), 'What is an individualized education plan/program (IEP)?': ('Autism Society', 'The Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is a written document that outlines a child’s education. As the name implies, the educational program should be tailored to the individual student to provide the maximum benefit. The key word is individual. A program that is appropriate for one child with autism may not be right for another.
